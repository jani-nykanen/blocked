## Blocked

A 99% finished puzzle game, I, for certain reasons, decided not to officially release. If you want to see what this game is about, build it by yourself (see below)


## Build instructions

1) Clone this repo to `go/src/github.com/jani-nykanen/`

2) Install Go binding of SDL2: [https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2)

3) `cd` to the repository root and type `make windows` or `make linux`, depending on your OS.

Either `game` or `game.exe` is created. That's all.
